Disease States - Data Exploration (SQL) and Visualization (Tableau)

The purpose of this project was to explore disease states, obesity rate and mortality rates at the state level within the United States. SQL was chosen to query the data to gain some insights.
I also wanted to visualize some key parts of this data to better understand our data and highlight important parts of it. Tableau was chosen for this purpose to visualize the data.

Table of Contents:
  I. Disease State Data Exploration PPT - this is a powerpoint file which contains audio which narrates my thoughts on the data and information. To automate the process of forwarding through slides, select slide show -> play from beginning
  II. Code and Files Folder
     A. CSV Files
        1. CSV Files Imported - Files are available from URL located in the powerpoint, but some cleaning was done so our SQL file could read the data.
        2. CSV Files Exported - The views created from our SQL queries.
     B. Population_Obesity_Mortality_Data_Exploration.sql
     C. Tableau Disease State Dashboard
 
To read our tableau workbook, we can open our .twbx file with Tableau reader or Tableau Desktop. Dashboard is located on the bottom ribbon on the right.
Some of the syntax for our SQL file is PostgreSQL syntax. In order to run all commands you may use MySQL Workbench (Or other preferred program) as long as PostgreSQL JDBC plugin is installed. Open MySQL workbench, click on local instance, enter password. Once on Navigator screen go to File -> Open and find SQL script. Then click on run.
